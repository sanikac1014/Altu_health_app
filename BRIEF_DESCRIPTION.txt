Development Process, Tradeoffs, and Future Improvements

Development Process:
I built Altu Life as a purely client-side React application, focusing on creating an intuitive health dashboard with AI-powered insights. The development process started with setting up the core data visualization using Recharts, then progressively added features like the Wellness Score, Habit Streaks, custom chart builder, and notification system. I prioritized making the LLM responses accurate by pre-computing exact answers for specific queries (like most/least used apps) before sending data to the AI, ensuring users get precise information rather than approximations.

Tradeoffs:
The main tradeoff was choosing a purely in-memory, client-side approach instead of a backend. This simplified deployment and made the app easier to run, but limited scalability for large datasets. I also chose to use GPT-4o-mini for cost efficiency, which works well for most queries but may have limitations with very complex analytical questions. The custom chart builder uses smart filtering to prevent nonsensical comparisons, which improves UX but requires maintaining a relationship matrix between metrics.

What I Would Do With More Time:
With more time, I would implement user authentication and data persistence, allowing users to upload their own health data. I'd add more sophisticated analytics like trend predictions, correlation analysis, and personalized health recommendations. I'd also enhance the notification system to be more intelligent, learning from user patterns to provide proactive insights. Additionally, I'd add data export functionality, more chart types, and the ability to set custom goals and track progress toward them.
