Development Process, Tradeoffs, and Future Improvements

Development Process:
I built Altu Life as a purely client-side React application, focusing on creating an intuitive health dashboard with AI-powered insights. The development process started with setting up the core data visualization using Recharts, then progressively added features like the Wellness Score, Habit Streaks, custom chart builder, and notification system. I prioritized making the LLM responses accurate by pre-computing exact answers for specific queries (like most/least used apps) before sending data to the AI, ensuring users get precise information rather than approximations.

Tradeoffs:
The main tradeoff was choosing a purely in-memory, client-side approach instead of a backend. This simplified deployment and made the app easier to run, but limited scalability for large datasets. I also chose to use GPT-4o-mini for cost efficiency, which works well for most queries but may have limitations with very complex analytical questions. The custom chart builder uses smart filtering to prevent nonsensical comparisons, which improves UX but requires maintaining a relationship matrix between metrics.

What I Would Do With More Time:
With more time, I would implement user authentication and data persistence so users can securely upload and store their own health data across sessions and devices. I’d expand the analytics layer with deeper trend analysis, correlation insights (e.g., exercise vs. sleep), and lightweight forecasting to highlight emerging patterns.
I’d also improve the “Ask Altu” experience by making the LLM more robust and genuinely data-grounded — instead of relying on simple keyword matching, I’d add a small intent + entity extraction layer so the assistant can better understand the question (metric, timeframe, app/category) and automatically run the right computations before responding. This would enable more accurate, contextual answers and richer follow-up questions.
Additionally, I’d enhance the notification system to learn from user patterns and deliver proactive, personalized insights, add more chart types and filtering, enable goal setting and progress tracking, and support data export for transparency and portability.
